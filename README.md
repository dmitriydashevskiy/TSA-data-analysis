# TSA-data-analysis
This repository was created to demonstrate code designed to process data from protein melting curves in the presence of a ligand to determine the thermodynamic parameters of melting. 
# Repository structure
The repository contains a code file 'Melt curve approximation final' and a folder containing example files for processing 'Example for processing'.
