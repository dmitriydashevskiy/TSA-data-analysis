# TSA-data-analysis
This repository was created to demonstrate code designed to process data from protein melting curves in the presence of a ligand to determine the thermodynamic parameters of melting. 
# Repository structure
The repository contains a code file 'Melt curve approximation final' and a folder containing example files for processing 'Example for processing'.
# Quick start guide
For a trial run of the program, enter the program 'Melt curve approximation final' and run the code.  The folder 'Example for processing' must be in the same directory as the program.  With these actions the data from the folder 'Example for processing' will be processed and files with analysis results will appear in this folder. 
To process your own data, group the data as indicated in the code. Copy the path to the folder with data and enter it into the variable 'directory_name'. Run the code. As a result, the program will show graphs of processing results, and files with processing results will appear in the data folder.
